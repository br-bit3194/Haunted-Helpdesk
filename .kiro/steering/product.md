# Product Overview

Haunted Helpdesk is an AI-powered multi-agent IT operations platform that automates incident resolution using intelligent agent workflows with persistent memory capabilities. The system features a Halloween-themed interface where six specialized AI agents work together to diagnose and resolve IT issues.

## Core Concept

IT operations platform disguised as a supernatural helpdesk where AI agents are represented as Halloween characters (ghosts, vampires, skeletons, etc.) that collaborate to resolve technical incidents.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Six specialized agents orchestrate ticket resolution through structured handoffs
- **Persistent Memory**: Learns from past resolutions to provide instant fixes for recurring issues
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Processes error screenshots alongside text descriptions
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically routes tickets to appropriate specialist agents
- **Real-time Visualization**: Shows agent handoffs and processing status in the UI

## The Six Agents

1. **Ghost Orchestrator** - Central routing and workflow coordination
2. **Skeleton Memory** - Persistent memory storage and retrieval
3. **Vampire Ticketing** - Ticket processing and status management
4. **Witch Network** - Network diagnostics (ping, traceroute, DNS)
5. **Reaper Cloud** - AWS/cloud service diagnostics (S3, etc.)
6. **Mummy Summarization** - Creates concise resolution summaries

## User Experience

Users submit IT tickets through a Halloween-themed interface. The system processes tickets through the agent workflow, displaying real-time progress with supernatural visual effects. Resolved tickets include detailed summaries and are stored for future reference.
